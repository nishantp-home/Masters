# Basic commands to import and explore data using h2o cluster

```{r}
library(h2o)
```

# Start up a 1-node H2O server on your local machine
```{r}
h2o.init(nthreads = -1, max_mem_size = "2G") # upto 2GB

# Clean slate - just in case was already running, they will be cleared
h2o.removeAll()
```

# Specify global file path, where data set is located
```{r}
file_path <- "E:\\Eskills-Academy-projects\\deepLearning-R-data\\Course-Data\\"
file_name <- "glassClass.csv"
glass_class_file <- paste(file_path, file_name, sep = "")
```
```{r}
glass <- h2o.importFile(glass_class_file)
```
```{r}
head(glass)
```
```{r}
summary(glass, exact_quantiles = TRUE)
```
```{r}
h2o.table(glass$K)
```

# Split dataset
```{r}
g_split <- h2o.splitFrame(data = glass, ratios = 0.75)
g_train <- g_split[[1]]
g_test <- g_split[[2]]
```
```{r}
head(g_train)
```
